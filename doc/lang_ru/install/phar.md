# Teleport Phar Installation

This is the easiest way to install and start using the Teleport application.

## Create a Working Directory for the Application

First, create a directory where you will run the Teleport application. Teleport will create subdirectories for it's work when being used, and it is best if you create it's own directory where it can live in isolation. A typical location might be `~/teleport/`.

## Download

Download the latest [`teleport.phar`](http://modx.s3.amazonaws.com/releases/teleport/teleport.phar "teleport.phar") distribution of Teleport into your Teleport working directory.

## Get Started

Get started using Teleport by [generating a Profile](../use/profile.md) of a local MODX installation.
